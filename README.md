## Projects 
### An Efficient Spectrum Accessing Technique In Cognitive Network Using Deep Learning Algorithm
[Publication](https://ijireeice.com/papers/an-efficient-spectrum-accessing-technique-in-cognitive-network-using-deep-learning-algorithm/)
Enhancements for spectrum sharing to facilitate uninterrupted secondary user transmission across the white band. Proposed and implemented a collaborative detection method, leveraging the power of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) to optimize spectrum sensing efficiency. Showed good performance, especially at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), resulting in minimized delays and significantly improved throughput
